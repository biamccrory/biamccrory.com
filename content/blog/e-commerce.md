# Be open to sales 24/7

## If you are a business that makes money, you should have an e-commerce capable website

**E-Commerce** is simply the ability to make money online with a website whether you're selling ***tangible goods***, ***digital assets*** such as mp3s, or the ***use rights*** to your digital artwork.

### What E-Commerce solution is right for me?

There are many options out there, but we try to stick with the most popular and reliable solutions.

### Shopify & WooCommerce

Both have pros and cons

- ***[Shopify][1]*** has an associated monthly cost, but you never have to worry about hosting.

- ***[WooCommerce][2]*** is free, but it relies on an established WordPress solution.

Both products are great at what they do, it really comes down to your individual business needs.

#### We tend to lean towards **Shopify** as our preferred solution simply because its built to do one thing and one thing only, be the **[best online e-commerce solution][3]**.

If you are working within a budget, WooCommerce along with WordPress are great choices, but dont forget to factor in all the associated costs such as hosting, and we mean FAST hosting, WordPress maintenance, etc.

Both solutions also have a plethora of free & paid plugins and extensions for marketing and other various e-commerce features.
